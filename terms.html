                        MUST TERMINATE SERVICE AS SET FORTH IN THE PRIOR

                        may be obtained by contacting them or visiting their
                        websites.&nbsp; Any arbitration shall be conducted
                        pursuant to the arbitration administrator's rules for
                        consumer disputes in effect when the arbitration is
                        initiated except to the extent they are inconsistent
                        with this arbitration agreement. If the arbitration
                        administrator will not enforce this arbitration
                        agreement as written, the parties shall agree on or

                        appoint a substitute arbitration administrator who will
                        do so. The arbitrator shall enforce contractual,
                        statutory and other limitation periods and shall honor
                        claims of privilege recognized at law. Judgment upon any
                        arbitration award may be entered in any court having
                        jurisdiction. If we initiate the arbitration, we will
                        notify you in writing at your then-current account
                        address or (if your account is closed) the last address
                        at which we contacted you. If you initiate the
                        arbitration, you must notify us in writing at the
                        address set forth in the &quot;Notices&quot; section. If
                        your Dispute does not exceed $10,000, we will reimburse
                        your filing fee and will pay the arbitrator's other
                        fees, costs and expenses. If you cannot pay the filing
                        fee, you may request that we pay the filing fee
                        directly. If, however, the arbitrator finds that your
                        Dispute is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose,
                        you shall reimburse the filing fee to us and the payment
                        of the arbitrator's other fees, costs and expenses shall
                        be governed by the arbitration administrator's rules.
                        You may hire an attorney to represent you in the
                        arbitration proceeding and may recover your attorneys'
                        fees and costs in arbitration to the same extent as you
                        could in court if the arbitration proceeding is decided
                        in your favor. We may hire an attorney to represent us
                        in the arbitration proceeding but waive any right to
                        recover our attorneys' fees and costs if the arbitration
                        proceeding is decided in our favor. Unless you and we
                        agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings
                        will be held in the county of your then-current account

                        ACTION WAIVER.&nbsp;WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE
                        RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT,
                        WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN
                        A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER OF A
                        CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court
                        or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us
                        that this waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration
                        agreement will be void as to you. Neither you, nor any
                        other customer, can be a class representative, class
                        member, or otherwise participate in a class,
                        consolidated or representative proceeding without a
                        court or arbitrator determination of
                        unenforceability.&nbsp;If a claim proceeds in court
                        rather than in arbitration, for any reason, WE EACH
                        WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. ARBITRATION INVOLVES A
                        FAIR HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR RATHER THAN A
                        JUDGE OR JURY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD DECLARATORY OR
                        INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY
                        NAMED IN THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING AND ONLY TO THE
                        EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT
                        PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. This arbitration agreement
                        shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the
                        Service relationship. Unless otherwise provided by
                        applicable law, or otherwise in this Agreement, neither
                        party has the right to bring a Dispute or other legal
                        action under this Agreement more than one (1) year after

                        the Services to you (the purchaser or user) by
                        FREEGOVSERVICES. Certain other laws and binding tariffs
                        for certain Services, which can be found at the
                        FREEGOVSERVICES website, may also govern our provision
                        of Services to you and these laws are incorporated in
                        their entirety by this reference into this Agreement as
                        if set forth specifically in this Agreement. Your
                        Services are also subject to, and you agree to adhere
                        to, our business policies, practices, and procedures,
                        which we can change without notice to you (collectively,
                        the &quot;Policies&quot;). Our Services and Rate Plans
                        are intended for reasonable use. The Rate Plan you
                        select determines the charges you are required to pay
                        for Service, including any applicable fees and
                        surcharges. Offers may not be available everywhere or

                        including the Rate Plan that you selected upon
                        initiation of Service. The Rate Plan, as modified by us
                        from time to time in accordance with this Agreement,
                        will remain in effect for the Term of your Service,
                        until or unless we change your Rate Plan or you choose
                        to subscribe to a different Rate Plan, if available to
                        you. If you wish to change your Rate Plan, you may
                        contact us to request a change. Rate Plan changes may
                        not be effective immediately, and you may be required to
                        pay to make such changes. We may change the price and
                        structure of your Rate Plan, and/or modify the costs,
                        services, or requirements of our Rate Plans at any time

                        provides, we may change the locations where such
                        Services may be used or where calls can be placed, or
                        rates and terms applicable to such locations, without
                        prior notice to you. Third parties may impose charges
                        upon FREEGOVSERVICES for providing Services to you, and
                        you agree to pay any such charges that FREEGOVSERVICES
                        passes through to you. If you are an existing customer,
                        you will be notified at least 15 days in advance of any
                        proposed changes that may result in more restrictive
                        terms or conditions, unless a longer period is required
                        by law. After that time period, any such changes will be
                        effective. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THESE
                        CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES, YOU
                        MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE OF
                        THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE. IF YOU DO

                        your Service through the date of cancellation. Subject
                        to applicable law, equipment may only be returned in
                        accordance with the return policies of the retailer that
                        you purchased your equipment form.&nbsp; If you
                        purchased equipment directly from TruConnnect, you will
                        be charged the difference between the amount you paid
                        FREEGOVSERVICES for the equipment and the amount you
                        would have been charged for the equipment had you not
                        agreed to a Service Contract. No activation fee will be
                        refunded, regardless. After the first 15 days, you may
                        terminate your Agreement for any reason. However, if you
                        do, you agree to pay any and all fees, charges, and/or
                        other amounts incurred and owed by you to

                        applicable early termination fee under your Service
                        Contract. Pre-paid Service is not subject to an early
                        termination fee or minimum initial term. After your
                        initial term ends and your Service continues on a

                        user of the device. For certain tax inclusive Rate
                        Plans, only applicable taxes and regulatory charges may
                        be included in the Rate Plan price. You must pay all
                        taxes, fees and surcharges set by federal, state and
                        local governments. To determine taxes, fees and
                        surcharges, we will use the street address you
                        identified as your Primary Service Address
                        (&quot;PSA&quot;). If you did not identify the correct
                        PSA, or if you provided us with an address that is not a
                        recognized street address, does not identify the
                        applicable taxing jurisdictions, or does not reflect the
                        Service area associated with your telephone number, you
                        may be assigned a default PSA. You acknowledge and agree
                        that a default PSA may affect your ability to receive
                        E-911 assistance and you agree to indemnify and hold
                        FREEGOVSERVICES harmless for any and all claims relating
                        to your failure to provide a valid PSA. In addition, if
                        you are not on a tax-inclusive plan, you agree to pay
                        all regulatory administration charges, which may
                        include, but are not limited to, Subscriber Line Charges
                        (“SLC”’s), Regulatory Cost Recovery Fees (“RCR”’s),
                        various administrative charges, gross receipts charges,
                        margin taxes, and charges for the costs we incur in
                        complying with governmental programs. Regulatory
                        administration charges are not taxes and are not
                        required by law. We set these charges, and the amounts
                        and what they include are subject to change. They are
                        rates we choose to collect from you and are kept by us
                        in whole or in part. The number and type of such charges
                        may vary depending upon your PSA and are subject to
                        change. We determine the rate for these charges and
                        these amounts are subject to change as are the
                        components used to calculate these amounts. Changes to
                        taxes, fees and surcharges will become effective as
                        provided by the taxing or regulatory authority and
                        changes to regulatory administration charges shall be
                        effective immediately. You may authorize recurring
                        payment of your charges or for your prepaid service
                        through a credit or debit card or bank transfer
                        authorization, which authorizes us to charge all amounts
                        you owe us to the credit or debit card or bank transfer
                        authorization up to 5 days prior to the due date and to
                        demand immediate payment from the card or debit issuer
                        or bank. Unless required by law, we will not give any
                        additional notice to you or obtain additional consent
                        from you before charging your bill to that credit or
                        debit card. You must promptly notify us of any change in
                        the credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization
                        you want to use for payment. You may also make a payment
                        by credit or debit card online through the
                        FREEGOVSERVICES website, or via phone through customer
                        service. You may pay your bill by bringing cash or a
                        check or money order in person to any FREEGOVSERVICES
                        store or a third party bill payment provider location.
                        You may be required to pay an additional processing
                        charge, depending on the payment method you choose. If
                        you pay with a check or another negotiable instrument
                        that is returned unpaid by a financial institution for
                        any reason, we may charge an additional fee of up to the
                        maximum amount permitted by law for each returned item.
                        We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to require
                        that you pay your bill with cash, certified check,
                        cashier's check or money order. We also reserve the
                        right to report any check returned to us to reporting

                        you may be charged a late fee, subject to the maximum

                        may be charged for data on a pay per use basis. We

                        Services depending on your selected Rate Plan. For Data
                        Services with a data usage limit, when you near your
                        data limit, we may send a text message or email to alert

                        the right to alter the types of usage that are
                        permissible for Data Services. Because the absolute
                        capacity of the wireless data network is limited, Data
                        Services may only be used for permissible purposes in
                        accordance with this Agreement. Pricing for Data
                        Services is device dependent and based on the
                        capabilities and capacity of each device. Compatible
                        data- enabled wireless devices are required. Data
                        Services usage includes, but is not limited to, the
                        actual data sent and received along with overhead,

                        in connection with a data session in which use of Data
                        Services occurs. Usage of Data Services on other
                        carriers' networks may not be available or may be

                        except to the extent permitted explicitly in your Rate

                        or tethering your device to a computer or other
                        hardware, are not permitted. Data Services may include,
                        for example, multimedia streaming and video on demand
                        services, as well as certain multimedia uploads,
                        downloads and gaming services and applications. Uploads
                        are data sessions where the data is transferred from
                        your Wireless Device to some other computer or wireless
                        device, while downloads are data sessions where the data
                        is transferred from some other computer or wireless
                        device to your Wireless Device. Data Services do not

                        this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that your Data

                        outside of our control, including but not limited to the
                        amount of users on the service, network congestion, the
                        distance to the serving cell site, the number of users

                        you are using for your data session, the screen size of
                        your Wireless Device, the bit rate(s) of your data

                        clock hour while in a session and at the end of each

                        All phone usage (including inbound/outbound calls,

                        periods with different pricing, minutes are charged
                        based on the call start time. We may impose limits on

                        emergency services like 911, may be unavailable,
                        interrupted or may fail, and call quality may at times
                        be poor. When you are outside of FREEGOVSERVICES's
                        coverage area, access will be limited to data and
                        applications previously downloaded to your device, and

                        use that information to provide you with Services and to
                        maintain and improve our wireless network. Your device
                        is also capable of using optional content offered by
                        FREEGOVSERVICES or third parties that uses your device's
                        location. You are subject to the terms and conditions
                        and other policies for those location-based services,
                        and should review those policies to learn how your
                        location information will be used. If you choose to use
                        location based services, you agree that we may use the
                        location information transmitted from your wireless
                        device to improve our location services, and you
                        authorize FREEGOVSERVICES to send targeted,
                        location-based information to your mobile device, and to
                        use or provide third parties with your location
                        information in aggregate form. Certain services that
                        rely on location information, such as E911 and GPS
                        navigation, depend on your wireless device's ability to
                        acquire satellite signals and network coverage. Unlike
                        traditional wireline telephones, 911 operators may not
                        know your telephone number or location. Due to
                        regulatory and technical requirements, FREEGOVSERVICES
                        makes no guarantee that emergency 911 calls will be
                        routed to a specific Public Safety Answering Point
                        (&quot;PSAP&quot;) or any particular public safety
                        organization, nor are we responsible for the acts or
                        omissions of those parties. Enhanced 911 service
                        (&quot;E911&quot;), where enabled by local emergency
                        authorities, uses GPS technology to provide location
                        information. However, even when available, E911 does not
                        always provide accurate location information. Your
                        wireless device may require you to affirmatively choose
                        to use location-based services, or you may choose to use
                        location-based services, other than E911.</span

                        for your use within our coverage area and on our
                        networks. Whenever your wireless device uses a
                        transmission site outside of our network coverage area,
                        or when your device uses another company's transmission
                        site, you are roaming. Your ability to
                        receive&nbsp;roaming coverage depends on the radio
                        transmissions that your device can receive and use.
                        Higher rates and additional charges may apply for
                        roaming calls, depending on your Services. If your
                        monthly usage is not predominantly on our networks, is
                        excessive, or causes FREEGOVSERVICES to incur too much
                        cost, FREEGOVSERVICES may terminate your service, deny
                        your continued use of other carriers' coverage, or
                        change your Rate Plan. If FREEGOVSERVICES intends to
                        take any of the above actions, it will provide you with
                        advance notice.&nbsp; Roaming is not available with

                        When a consumer submits an enrollment request to receive
                        the Texas LifeLine discounts for cell phone service the
                        consumer has to wait up to 30 days to submit another
                        enrollment request. A consumer CANNOT have multiple
                        enrollment requests for the Texas LifeLine discounts for
                        cell phone service going at the same time. The 30-day
                        waiting period ends when either 1) the Texas LifeLine
                        Administrator sends the final eligibility decision, 2)
                        the enrollment request is cancelled, or 3) the 30 days
                        have passed since the enrollment request, whichever
                        occurs first. After the 30-day clock stops, a consumer
                        may then submit another enrollment request for the Texas
                        LifeLine discounts for cell phone service, as
                        applicable. A consumer can independently cancel an
                        enrollment request by contacting the Texas LifeLine
